Our team of four developed a web application in just 24 hours for the Code for All Hackathon, which marked the culmination of our 14-week intensive bootcamp. 

The theme for the hackathon was "Childhood Memories," and our team was assigned the popular TV series Powerpuff Girls.

The web app features a Java backend with MySQL for data persistence, complemented by a frontend webpage created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
